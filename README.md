# EarthquakeReport
This is an Networking based application that uses USGS API to fetch list of recent earthquakes
according to user's choice.

## Lessons Learned

I have learned to use Networking concepts like JSON parsing , use of APIs , HTTP Networking , 
background Threads and Parallelism , setting prefrences , using menu etc. to present list of 
latest earthquakes.
